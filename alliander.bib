  abstract = {The value of a non-pecuniary (free) product is inherently difficult to assess. A pervasive example is open source software (OSS), a global public good that plays a vital role in the economy and is foundational for most technology we use today. However, it is difficult to measure the value of OSS due to its non-pecuniary nature and lack of centralized usage tracking. Therefore, OSS remains largely unaccounted for in economic measures. Although prior studies have estimated the supply side costs to recreate this software, a lack of data has hampered estimating the much larger demand-side (usage) value created by OSS. Therefore, to understand the complete economic and social value of widely-used OSS, we leverage unique global data from two complementary sources capturing OSS usage by millions of global firms. We first estimate the supply-side value by calculating the cost to recreate the most widely used OSS once. We then calculate the demand side value based on a replacement value for each firm that uses the software and would need to build it internally if OSS did not exist. We estimate the supply-side value of widely-used OSS is \$4.15 billion, but that the demand-side value is much larger at \$8.8 trillion. We find that firms would need to spend 3.5 times more on software than they currently do if OSS did not exist. The top six programming languages in our sample comprise 84\% of the demand-side value of OSS. Further, 96\% of the demand-side value is created by only 5\% of OSS developers.},

  abstract = {The EU goals for renewable electricity cause significant changes of electrical loads in distribution systems, in which most renewable electricity sources are integrated. This poses a challenge for distribution system operators (DSOs) as their networks are not designed for such load changes. DSOs could use networks more efficiently with demand side management (DSM), where consumers of electricity alter their consumption patterns, shifting (production/consumption) loads in the distribution system. In such a setting, consumers would trade DSM services with the DSOs. However, currently, DSOs follow the ‘copper plate approach’, which assumes the system should have sufficient capacity to ensure that the desired volumes of electricity can be transported. This seeks to guarantee regulated third party access (rTPA) for all system users. Next to rTPA, based on regulated tasks, DSOs should ensure secure, reliable and efficient systems. In doing so, the DSOs are bound by unbundling requirements, which do not allow them to be involved in any activities other than those related to distribution. Therefore, especially production and supply are not allowed. Still, it seems debatable whether EU law allows DSOs to apply DSM, as it has an impact on both the access conditions to the electricity system, and the production, supply and trade of electricity. This article further analyses how DSM relates to the legal framework of DSOs, which obstacles are present, and how DSM could be traded between DSOs and system users.},

  abstract = {Electricity market design becomes increasingly important with growing shares of renewable energy in the electricity system. This article examines zonal market designs and their compatibility with ongoing energy transitions, focusing on two types of zonal market designs: the Nordic market with numerous, smaller zones, and the German “copper plate approach” with one, national zone. It assesses the dominant ideas and institutional logics within the two market designs. Perceptions of what kind of market design works best and is most efficient vary significantly, in line with the roles and interests of dominant stakeholders. Overall, the Nordic market is found to be better aligned with the energy transition in terms of flexibility, portfolio effects and system costs. The German market has considerably higher system costs but provides better conditions for long-term trading.},

  abstract = {Development of open-source software (OSS) is widespread, and OSS is important to measure as both capital output and as an input to production. In this paper, we develop time series estimates of annual nominal and real investment and real capital stocks in OSS in the United States. We use data on OSS projects from GitHub, the largest OSS platform with over 31 million users and developers worldwide. We collect 5.2 million project repositories, containing metadata such as author, license, commits (approved code edits), and lines of code. Following methods used in software engineering to estimate the resource cost associated with creating OSS, we use lines of code and project complexity as the measure of effort to estimate the time spent on software development. In addition, we use existing methodologies for measurement of software in the U.S. national economic accounts to estimate both the annual investment and the capital stocks in software that is shared on GitHub. Our estimates show that U.S. investment in OSS was \$38 billion and the real capital stock nearly \$120 billion (constant 2012 U.S. dollars) in 2019.},

  abstract = {"Energy humanities is a field of scholarship that, like medical humanities and digital humanities before it, overcomes traditional boundaries between the disciplines and between academic and applied research. Like its predecessors, energy humanities highlights the essential contribution that the insights and methods of the human sciences can make to areas of study and analysis once thought best left to the natural sciences. This isn't a case of the humanities simply helping their cross-campus colleagues to learn the mechanics of communication so that they might better articulate their ideas. Rather, these fields of scholarship are ones that demonstrate how the scale and complexity of the issues being explored demand insights and approaches that transcend old school disciplinary boundaries. Energy Humanities : A Reader offers a carefully curated selection of the best and most influential work in energy humanities that has appeared over the past decade. To stay true to the diverse work that makes up this emergent field, selections range from anthropology and geography to philosophy, history, and cultural studies to recent energy-focused interventions in art and literature. The three readers all agree that this is an important, ground-breaking collection of work"--Provided by publisher},
